Description: # THAW
        Thaw is a tool that identifies outdated libraries in your requirements.txt file and generates a report file showing you exactly where updates would affect your project.
        
        # Python 3 
        Not compatible with Python 2
        
        # Install:
        ```
        $ pip install thaw
        ```
        
        # Run:
        
        Thaw *must* be run on the same level as your requirements.txt file (usually at the top level of your project).
        
        ```
        $ python -m thaw
        ``` 
        or
        ```
        $ python3 -m thaw
        ```
        This generates a report file, thaw_report.txt, at the same level that thaw was run.
        
        # Use Cases
        Thaw is helpful for CI and for updating project dependencies.
        
        
        # Info
        
        Thaw was created because it's super frustrating to update libraries for a project and then cycle through running your project and fixing a single error at a time. Thaw tells you which libraries are used where, including variables made with those libraries, so you can easily pinpoint where problems may occur and have a roadmap for fixing update-induced errors.
        
        ✅  &nbsp; Thaw uses only built-in Python libraries - no dependencies to download
        
        ✅  &nbsp; Thaw checks requirements.txt for outdated versions and then searches your entire project
        
        ✅  &nbsp; Thaw identifies files in the project that use these outdated versions
        
        ✅  &nbsp; Thaw identifies which lines in those files use these outdated versions
        
        ✅  &nbsp; Thaw identifies any variables in those files that are made with outdated library versions
        
        ✅  &nbsp; Thaw creates a report file, thaw_report.txt, detailing all of that information
        
        
        
        # Notes / planned additions:
        - Explicitly distinguish between directly required libraries and dependencies
        - Note dependency-affected lines as well as directly affected lines
