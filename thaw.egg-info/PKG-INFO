Description: # pip-thaw
        Package update tool that:
        
        ✅ uses only built-in Python libraries - no dependencies to download
        
        ✅ checks requirements.txt for outdated versions
        
        ✅ identifies files in the project that use these outdated versions
        
        ✅ identifies lines in those files that use these outdated versions
        
        ❌ identifies variables in those files that are made with outdated versions
        
        ✅ creates report file detailing which lines in which files would be affected by selected updates
        
        # Install:
        ```$ pip install thaw``` (...except this isn't a full package yet so please don't try to install it)
        
        # Use:
        ```$ python thaw``` >> generates report file thaw_report.txt
        
        # Notes:
        The report file is pretty ugly right now and it doesn't distinguish between directly required libraries and dependencies. 
        
        Report file should note primary/secondary package, should break packages up into minor/major/micro categories, ?should include just list of packages that don't need updates?, should be much better formatted (possibly as checklist)
