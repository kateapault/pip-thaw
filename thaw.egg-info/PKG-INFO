Description: # THAW
        Thaw is a tool that identifies outdated libraries in your requirements.txt file and generates a report file showing you exactly where updates would affect your project.
        
        
        # Install:
        ```
        $ pip install thaw
        ```
        
        # Use:
        ```
        $ python3 thaw.py
        ``` 
        This generates a report file, thaw_report.txt, at the same level that thaw was run.
        
        # Info
        
        ✅  &nbsp; uses only built-in Python libraries - no dependencies to download
        
        ✅  &nbsp; checks requirements.txt for outdated versions
        
        ✅  &nbsp; identifies files in the project that use these outdated versions
        
        ✅  &nbsp; identifies lines in those files that use these outdated versions
        
        ✅  &nbsp; identifies variables in those files that are made with outdated versions
        
        ✅  &nbsp; creates report file detailing which lines in which files would be affected by selected updates
        
        # Notes:
        
        
        # Planned additions / fixes:
        - Reformat the report file to make it easier to read
        - Explicitly distinguish between directly required libraries and dependencies
        - Note which lines dependencies affect (at the moment thaw only identifies directly used libraries)
